# Interective-Art

Inspiration
The inspiration for this interactive poster came from the artwork we chose itself. The artwork that we decided to advertise in our poster is OCM II by Florence To. 
OCM is a collection of architectural renderings of the artist's creative process in various places. This animation was created as a prototype for visualising a 3D 
model of a 360-degree spherical projection screen in a dome setting, using the item's velocity to generate a natural sensation of gravity and a psychological effect. 
The artwork OCM II by portraying living on a level devoid of technology, presents a tale about how memory may be disoriented, twisted, and dysfunctional while operating 
as a linear path to individuation. As we studied the artwork, we realised that from afar, it looked like that the artist was playing with the movement of a grid, a 
dynamic movement that went about a 360-degree spherical surface. And this is what inspired our interactive poster; we decided to include this element of having lines 
fading in and out.

Usage Instructions.
The text containing the exhibition details will show on a simple white backdrop when the program is played. Lines on the background begin to fade in when one presses 
any of the mouse buttons until all of the lines are solid black. When one of the mouse buttons is pressed again, the lines fade away until they are gone.
